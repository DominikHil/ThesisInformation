# Miscellaneous Tips

## Setting Up LaTeX
I recommend editing LaTeX in VS Code using the “LaTeX Workshop” extension.

Workflow:
1. Install a LaTeX distribution (recommended: TeX Live): https://www.tug.org/texlive/

        sudo apt install texlive-full

2. Install the VS Code “LaTeX Workshop” extension.
3. Open the LaTeX project; on save (or via the extension’s “Run” button) it should build a PDF.


## Setting up GitHub/GitLab and SSH Credentials
To connect to GitHub (or GitLab) securely, use SSH keys.

SSH authentication works via a public/private keypair:
- **Public key**: can be shared and added to GitHub/GitLab for authentication.
- **Private key**: must never be shared.

On Linux, SSH keys are typically stored under `~/.ssh/`, e.g.:
- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (private key)
- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public key)

Create a keypair (if you do not have one yet):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This should create `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` in `~/.ssh`. You can show the public key using

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```


Then add it to your account by pasting the output of the above `cat id_ed25519.pub` command:
- GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys (click “New SSH Key”)
- GitLab: https://gitlab.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/-/user_settings/ssh_keys

Afterwards you should be able to clone a repository via SSH, e.g.:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SOMEUSER/SOME_REPOSITORY.git
```

### SSH Login to Servers (Passwordless)
Add your public key to a server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id USER@SERVER
```

Running this command will prompt you for the password. After that, login should work without a password prompt: 

```bash
ssh USER@SERVER
```

## Linting / Language Server Support

### Python
For Python linting / language-server features, you may need to configure extra import paths.

Add (or edit) a workspace-local `.vscode/settings.json` and set:

```jsonc
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "./openpi/packages/openpi-client/src",
        "./deoxys_control/deoxys/"
    ]
}
```

### C++
For C++ IntelliSense, you can configure `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`.

You can manually set `includePath`, but the most reliable setup is using a `compile_commands.json` so IntelliSense matches the real compiler flags. To generate `compile_commands.json` add the `--cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` flag (example with `colcon`):

```bash
colcon build --mixin ninja --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
```

Example `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`:

```jsonc
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "ROS2",
            "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                "/opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/include/**"
            ],
            "defines": [],
            "intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64",
            "cppStandard": "c++17"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```



## VS Code Keybindings
For some programs that I find very useful, you can refer to [.linux_autosetup/install_script.sh](https://github.com/David0tt/.linux_autosetup/blob/main/install_script.sh). In particular, I highly recommend using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git) for efficient search in the terminal.

For keyboard shortcuts I personally find useful you can refer to [Hotkeys.md](https://github.com/David0tt/.linux_autosetup/blob/main/Hotkeys.md) or [vscode_linux_keybindings.json](https://github.com/David0tt/.linux_autosetup/blob/main/config_files/VSCode/vscode_linux_keybindings.json)
